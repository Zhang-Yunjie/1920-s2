This was adapted from [Question 521](https://piazza.com/class/k54zo22zq1t2zc?cid=521) from Piazza. 

Given the following set of code: 

```java
public class Box<T> {
    public static <T> Box<T>  of () {}; 
}
```

We discover that we will need to declare `<T>` once again. Is there a particular reason why `<T>` needs to be added before `Box<T>` for static methods as shown above? 

Well as we remmeber, static methods belong to the class, while non-static methods belong to the instance of the class. 

Different instances of the class Box, may have different type parameters `<T>`, i.e. Box of different types, `Box<Integer>`, `Box<String>` etc. However, static methods, as well as static variables, are **class level** so all instances of the class Box have access to the same static of() method. 

That **would not be possible** if the type parameter of the static method is referring to the class type parameter `<T>`, since `<T>` may differ across instances of the class Box. Therefore, what we need to do is to define a **local type parameter** specific to the scope of the static method. 

The type parameter `U`  created in static `<U>`, is then infered by Java for `U` in `Box<U>` ,U in argument (U u), and `U` in the return type of new `Box<U>()`, or just new `Box<>()` for short.

In conclusion, as stated in the lecture note, the `<T> `in the static method **has no relation** with the class type `<T>` in `Box <T>`. 
In order to minimize confusion, you may consider choosing a letter (eg `<U>`) that is different from the type parameter in your main class (eg `<T>`).
